The output of the model was poor. Most of the R-squared, adjusted R-squared are all very low. On checking out their p-value it was noticed that evaporation had value lower than the acceptable value of 0.05, precipitation had a closer range value, even though higher, so I reduced the independent / predictors variable but that didn't make any difference for the output of the model because I was still getting a poor model, I concluded Linear regression may not be the best and that it may come out good with other models. 

## Random Forest Classifer

The random forest classifier showed lower level of accuracy compared to the XGBoost, however I used it on all the potholes after I had converted them to values 0 and 1 respectively.

For the Bunny potholes, all the dry condition were correct why the wet is not accurate. This was also the case for Wallnut, Mouth, and Gravy.

The Lettuce is the only potholes that showed some level of variation in the output of the prediction, there were 16 predictions that were correct for the wet condition. The dry condition was also accurate missing just one prediction out of the accuracy. The variable importance showed precipitation to be the most important of all the variable and the evaporation is the least important.

## XGBoost

For this model, I used the confusion matrix and the ROC-AUC metrics to check out how good each of the models applied to the potholes, the XGBoost is a scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting machines and it has proven to push the limits of computing power for boosted trees algorithms as it was built and developed for the sole purpose of model performance and computational speed.

- Bunny Pothole

The prediction for the dry condition was very high(99%), why the wet condition was just 50% predicted correctly and the ROC_AUC was 0.9429 which is high but we could get a better result if the dataset are well balanced.

- Wallnut Pothole

The prediction for the dry condition was very high(97%), why the wet condition was just 56% predicted correctly and the ROC_AUC was 0.9265 which is high but we could get a better result if the dataset are well balanced.

- Lettuce Pothole

The prediction for the dry condition was very high(90%), why the wet condition was also high, with 83% predicted correctly and the ROC_AUC was 0.9453 which is high and the only conclusion for such result would be because the count showed lettuce had a good range of dry to wet and its relatively balanced.

- Mouth Pothole

The prediction for the dry condition was very high(95%), why the wet condition was just 30% predicted correctly and the ROC_AUC was 0.8441 which is high but we could get a better result if the dataset are well balanced.

- Gravy Pothole

The prediction for the dry condition was very high(100%), why the wet condition was just 58% predicted correctly and the ROC_AUC was 0.9754 which is high but we could get a better result if the dataset are well balanced.
