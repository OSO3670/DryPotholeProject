For this project, the data were retrieved from the series of fieldwork done on the eight potholes water depth research. The pothole project started in 2016, with a significant focus on measuring the water quality in those potholes, monitoring the depth of water in them; this is important because of the persistent inundation of surrounding farmlands.

For five years(2016-2020), these potholes have been examined.  The data for some of the potholes were missing in some of the years.  After proper evaluation, a decision was made to explore five(5) potholes in this region and how weather conditions influence the potholes' dry and wet conditions.

Also, in the quest to model with the dataset, it was essential to examine the dataset's quality. Some missing data were replaced with the mean of the columns. The wrangling of the dataset for daily data collection had been earlier been done using pivot on excel. Other cleanings, arranging, and formatting was subsequently carried out using the python Jupyter notebook.

Visualization was carried out on the dataset using pair plots, bar plots, and heat correlation map. All these were carried out using the i-python; subsequently, all models used(Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGboost) were also developed using the python Jupyter notebook.

The linear regression model was applied on the pothole's dataset when still in the numeric format, and it was converted afterward to a categorical variable in both wet and dry categories. The dry conditions are recorded water depths of zero, while the wet conditions are recorded as water depths greater than zero. The XGboost were applied on the data set to check how well the climatic condition would influence the prediction of either dry or wet conditions, and the random forest was also used on the dataset after it had been converted to '0' (Dry)  or '1' (Wet). A comparison was also made between each of the models to determine which would be good in the prediction of dry and wet conditions.
