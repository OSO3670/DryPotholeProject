# Prediction of potholes dry condition
{: .text-#663399}

The purpose of this project is to check the interaction or relationship betweeen climatic conditions and pothole water depth, to further check if the any of the climatic factors particularly affected the dry period of the potholes.

Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods during the year(EPA,2021). Wetlands are crucial to nature's survival, and Ramsar Convention had described them as lakes, rivers, swamps, floodplains, peatland, mangroves, estuaries, shorelines, coral reefs, marshes. They are crucial in the natural filtration and storage of water; they are home to 40% of the world's plants and animals, one-third of all bird species depends on wetlands, two-third of fishes live there, they are used in production, they serve as nature's shock absorber, they hold more carbon than all the forest
combined and thereby sequester carbon and acts as sediment traps for runoff.

These peculiar benefits of wetlands are what communities enjoy with the Prairie potholes, depression wetlands found in the upper Midwest, especially North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. Therefore we need to pay attention to their usage, structure, and water level. There is a shift in the average condition of the weather over time regarded as climate change. Knowing what influences changes in a pothole would be great, especially relative to the climate change of the environment.
