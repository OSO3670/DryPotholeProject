The box plot gave an insight into each of the climatic factors in comparison to the potholes.

- Bunny Potholes:

For the precipitation, there were more wet condition relative to high precipitation which shows that in a way that they influence wet and dry condition, for both tmax and tmin, they had higher dry conditions, though, it showed relatively small difference when the output was critically examined, the evaporation is tilting towards drying, this is true because the higher the evaporation, the higher the tendency of potholes to dry.

- Wallnut and Gravy Potholes:

For Wallnut, the wet conditions was higher with higher precipitation but there was a disparity in what is obtainable for the tmax and the tmin, where the wet seems higher for increasing temperture, this was also the case for the Gravy potholes, as the temperature was increasing, there were more wet condition, this I would say it is based on how much of data it was fed with and the time of the year this datas were collected.

- Mouth

For the Mouth potholes, the precipitation increased and the wet conditions also showing higher representation, as the tmin and tmax increased there was more dry conditions, this was the same case with both the radiation and the evaporation, with increasing radiation and evaporation, there was an increasing representation of the dry condition.

- Lettuce

For the Lettuce potholes, the precipitation increased, as did the representation of wet conditions; as the tmin and tmax increased, so did the representation of dry conditions; this was also true for radiation and evaporation; as radiation and evaporation increased, so did the representation of dry conditions.

The visualization of the potholes(Bunny, Wallnut, Mouth, Gravy, Lettuce) depth on a yearly basis.The Bunny showed that only the datasest for 2020 was very high relative to the other years, for other years most especially 2017 and 2018, the dataset output are scanty. From this trend, I would conclude for the Bunny, that it is increasing over the year. This was a repitive trend for Wallnut. But for the Mouth and Gravy, reverse was the case, because the year 2018 showed higher level of water depth compared to other years, 2019 and 2017 also had some level of water but for 2020, it was low for Mouth pothole why for the Gravy pothole, 2018 was the highest, followed by the 2020 and 2018 as well, but the 2016 and 2017 just had relatively low amount of water depth. 2020 was the highest for lettuce followed by 2018 and 2019, there were some level of water depth in 2016 while the 2017 had no visible amount of water.

For pair plot and Heat map, there are varieity of them on the notebook
