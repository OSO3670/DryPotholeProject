The box plot gave an insight into each of the climatic factors in comparison to the potholes.

- Bunny Potholes:

For the precipitation, there were more wet condition relative to high precipitation which shows that in a way that they influence wet and dry condition, for both tmax and tmin, they had higher dry conditions, though, it showed relatively small difference when the output was critically examined, the evaporation is tilting towards drying, this is true because the higher the evaporation, the higher the tendency of potholes to dry.

- Wallnut and Gravy Potholes:

For Wallnut, the wet conditions was higher with higher precipitation but there was a disparity in what is obtainable for the tmax and the tmin, where the wet seems higher for increasing temperture, this was also the case for the Gravy potholes, as the temperature was increasing, there were more wet condition, this I would say it is based on how much of data it was fed with and the time of the year this datas were collected.

- Mouth

For the Mouth potholes, the precipitation increased and the wet conditions also showing higher representation, as the tmin and tmax increased there was more dry conditions, this was the same case with both the radiation and the evaporation, with increasing radiation and evaporation, there was an increasing representation of the dry condition.

- Lettuce

For the Lettuce potholes, the precipitation increased, as did the representation of wet conditions; as the tmin and tmax increased, so did the representation of dry conditions; this was also true for radiation and evaporation; as radiation and evaporation increased, so did the representation of dry conditions.
