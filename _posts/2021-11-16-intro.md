#### What are Wetlands

Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil or is present either at or near the surface of the soil  all  year  or  for  varying  periods  during  the  year(EPA,2021).  Wetlands  are  crucial  to  nature's survival,  and  Ramsar  Convention  had  described  them  as  lakes,  rivers,  swamps,  floodplains, peatland, mangroves, estuaries, shorelines, coral reefs, marshes. They are crucial in the natural filtration  and  storage  of  water;  they  are  home  to  40%  of  the  world's  plants  and  animals,  one-third  of  all  bird  species  depends  on  wetlands,  two-third  of  fishes  live  there,  they  are  used  in production, they serve as nature's shock absorber, they hold more carbon than all the forest combined and thereby sequester carbon and acts as sediment traps for runoff.


#### What are Potholes

Prairie potholes are depressional wetlands (primarily freshwater marshes) found most often in the Upper Midwest, especially North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. This formerly glaciated landscape is pockmarked with an immense number of potholes, which fill with snowmelt and rain in the spring. Some prairie pothole marshes are temporary, while others may be essentially permanent. Here a pattern of rough concentric circles develops. Submerged and floating aquatic plants take over the deeper water in the middle of the pothole while bulrushes and cattails grow closer to shore. Wet, sedgy marshes lie next to the upland.

Millions of them span approximately 800,000 km2 region stretching from the Canadian Prairies through North and South Dakota, Montana, Minnesota, and Iowa

These wetlands have been a blessing to several communities because of the need to use them as a potential means of irrigation their farms in the south where it is a liitle warmer, however, it is has resulted into inundation of farms in other areas where they already have sufficient amount of rainfall such as in Iowa.

The pothole project has been explored over the years exploring, the depth of the water and how it influences inundation of land in the area where these potholes are located.This is important because, the level of water in the potholes do have a ripple effect on the how well the crops planted in the region would flourish. Because  water-logging of this region would affect the aeration plants. This project would be considering the state of the potholes in Iowa, are climatic conditions influencing how wet or dry they are, what would be possible expectation in the years to come, the approach is in using data analytics to draw inferences that would help in making critical decisions in these areas. 

# Data Used

The potholes considered for this analysis are Bunny, Wallnut, Mouth, Gravy and Lettuce

The weather data used to analyze the project are precipitation, the minimum temperature, mean temperature, maximum temperature, the dewpoint temperature, minimum vapour pressure, maximum vapour pressure, radiation and evaporation. The data is not all year round, it is just limited to 5th month of the year to 10th month of the year on the average.
