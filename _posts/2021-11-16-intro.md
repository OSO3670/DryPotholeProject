#### What are Wetlands?

Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil or is present either at or near the surface of the soil  all  year  or  for  varying  periods  during  the  year(EPA,2021).  Wetlands  are  crucial  to  nature's survival.  The Ramsar  Convention  had  described  them  as  lakes,  rivers,  swamps,  floodplains, peatland, mangroves, estuaries, shorelines, coral reefs, marshes. They are crucial in the natural filtration  and  storage  of  water;  they  are  home  to  40%  of  the  world's  plants  and  animals,  one-third  of  all  bird  species  depends  on  them,  two-third  of  fishes  live  there,  they  are  used  in production, they serve as nature's shock absorber, they hold more carbon than all the forest combined and thereby sequester carbon and acts as sediment traps for runoff.


#### What are Potholes?

Prairie potholes are depressional wetlands (primarily freshwater marshes) found most often in the Upper Midwest, especially North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. This formerly glaciated landscape is pockmarked with an immense number of potholes, which fill with snowmelt and rain in the spring. Some prairie pothole marshes are temporary, while others may be essentially permanent. 

Millions of them span approximately 800,000 km2 region stretching from the Canadian Prairies through North and South Dakota, Montana, Minnesota, and Iowa

These potholes have been a blessing to several communities because of the need to use them as a potential means of irrigation for their farms in the south where it is a liitle warmer, however, it is has resulted into inundation of farms in other areas where there are sufficient amount of rainfall such as in Iowa.

The pothole project has been explored over the years, the depth of the water and how it influences inundation of land in the area where these potholes are located. This is important because, the level of water in the potholes do have a ripple effect on the how well the crops planted in the region would flourish. Water-logging of this potholes would affect the aeration plants. So many researches had look into inundation, drainage level, however, this project would be considering the state of the potholes in Iowa, and to check the influence climatic conditions on wetness and dryness of the potholes and to also know what would be the possible expectation in the years to come, the approach is in using data analytics to draw inferences that would help in making critical decisions in these areas. 

#### Data Used

The potholes considered for this analysis are Bunny, Wallnut, Mouth, Gravy and Lettuce.

The weather data used to analyze the project are precipitation, the minimum temperature, mean temperature, maximum temperature, the dewpoint temperature, minimum vapour pressure, maximum vapour pressure, radiation and evaporation. The data is not all year round, it is just limited to 5th month of the year to 10th month of the year on the average.
