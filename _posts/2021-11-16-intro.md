#### What are Potholes

Prairie potholes are depressional wetlands (primarily freshwater marshes) found most often in the Upper Midwest, especially North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. This formerly glaciated landscape is pockmarked with an immense number of potholes, which fill with snowmelt and rain in the spring. Some prairie pothole marshes are temporary, while others may be essentially permanent. Here a pattern of rough concentric circles develops. Submerged and floating aquatic plants take over the deeper water in the middle of the pothole while bulrushes and cattails grow closer to shore. Wet, sedgy marshes lie next to the upland.

Millions of them span approximately 800,000 km2 region stretching from the Canadian Prairies through North and South Dakota, Montana, Minnesota, and Iowa.

These wetlands have been a blessing to several communities because of the need to use them as a potential means of irrigation their farms in the south where it is a liitle warmer, however, it is has resulted into inundation of farms in other areas where they already have sufficient amount of rainfall such as in Iowa.

This project would be considering the state of the potlands in Iowa, are climatic conditions influencing how wet or dry they are, what would be possible expectation in the years to come, the approach is in using data analytics to draw inferences that would help in making critical decisions in these areas.
